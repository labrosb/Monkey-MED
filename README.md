<h1> Monkey-MED </h1>
<p> Monkey-MED is my master's thesis. It's an m-Health Information System for Android devices designed to help patients in the post-stoke rehabilitation phase using gamification techniques.</p>
<p> The system consists of EMG (electromyography) bio-sensors, a raspbery-pi microcomputer and an Android App.</p>
<p> The EMG biosensors track the patient's muscular activity, sending the data to the raspberry pi which proccess and forwards the data through either Blouetooth* or MQTT Protocol. Finally the data are sent to the Android device enabling the patient to move objects in the gaming environment by streching his muscles. </p>
