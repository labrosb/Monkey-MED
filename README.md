<p> Monkey-MED is my master's thesis. It's an m-Health Information System for Android devices designed to help patients in the post-stoke rehabilitation phase using gamification techniques. </p>
<p> The system consists of EMG (electromyography) bio-sensors, a microcomputer and an Android App.</p>
<p> The EMG biosensors track the patient's muscular activity, sending the data to a microcomputer which proccess and forwards the data    through either Bluetooth or MQTT Protocol.
<br />
Finally the data are sent to the Android device enabling the patient to move objects in the gaming environment by streching his muscles. </p>
<p>Year of implementation : 2016</p>
<p>Project : Individualy implemented</p>
